### How to update npm

```bash
sudo npm install -g npm
```
Occasionally, the version of npm will progress such that the current version cannot be properly installed with the version that you have installed already. (Consider, if there is ever a bug in the update command.) In those cases, you can do this:

```bash
curl https://www.npmjs.com/install.sh | sh
```
